#Linking a stylesheet

\<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="\<address>">

The link tag (placed in head) is used to link a document and an external 
resource, not for hyperlinks, for which we use href

It is possible to combine style sheets as so:

\<LINK rel=stylesheet href="basics.css" title="contemp"\>
\<LINK rel=stylesheet href="tables.css" title="contemp"\>

#Using styles in HTML

There are many ways. One way is to just create a name for the selector then
wrap it around things (after linking the CSS file of course).

i.e. <customSelector></customSelector>

Or you can override the style element in the head sections

<style type="text/css">

custom {color: blue}

</style>

Or you can just write h1 {...} which will affect all h1 tags.
